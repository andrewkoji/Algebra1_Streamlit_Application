# The problem with high school math
High School Math needs a serious facelift. As time has gone on, the sentiment of high school math has become very negative. For struggling students, this is 
an even more serious problem. Students need more interactive materials that engage them in learning and need to start finding the fun in learning mathematical concepts.
The traditional pencil and paper model is not enough for those at serious deficits. 

## FastAPI - Deployment
As a library for use in the application, a FastAPI Api has been developed! So far, it contains various mathematical functions and concepts that the apps
call the API on for use. The goal for the API is to build a completely independent source for the applications to use when deployed. 

## Deployment - Render
The curriculum is deployed through streamlit on the Render platform. Here are the links to the completed parts of the curriculum so far!

1. STATS - https://algebra1-curriculum.onrender.com/
2. LINEAR FUNCTIONS - https://linear-functions.onrender.com/
3. LINEAR-QUADRATIC SYSTEMS - https://linear-quadratic-system.onrender.com/
4. SEQUENCES - https://algebra1-streamlit-application.onrender.com/

The applications are developed with intention to align with the Algebra 1 Next Generation Standards. Instructors should be able to use this platform to aid in their
instruction and there is also practice problems for students to use.
